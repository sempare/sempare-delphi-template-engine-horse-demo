# Sempare Template Engine demo using Horse

NOTE: using BOSS won't work to pull in the Sempare Template Engine as it depends on the latest pre-release version which is not released yet. BOSS can't detect it (or I can't see how to map onto it yet)

## Setup

- Ensure you have the BOSS dependency manager

```
  Download it from https://github.com/hashload/boss/releases
```

- Clone the demo project

```
  git clone https://github.com/sempare/sempare-delphi-template-engine-horse-demo
```

- Get the dependencies

```
  boss update
```

- Open SempareTemplateEngineHorseDemo.dproj in the Delphi IDE

## Dependencies

This demo depends on the following packages:
- horse
- sempare-delphi-template-engine (v1.7.0 - dev branch) (not released yet 1 Apr 2023)
